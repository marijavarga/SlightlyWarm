# SlightlyWarm

Welcome to Slightly Warm game! This is my First Person Shooter game developed in Unreal Engine 4.9. This README provides an overview of the game, gameplay mechanics and other information. 


## Introduction

This is a First-person shooter game I've done for my Bachelor final assignment. 
I've made an entire game using Unreal Engine. As a reference I used SuperHot game which I really liked playing. Because it's very similar to this game I named mine Slightly Warm. 
Some models were modeled using 3Ds Max, and some models were downloaded. 
The focus was on the game mechanics, time dilation and minimal design.
The most interesting part of this project for me was implementing AI enemies. 
I really enjoyed making this game.
